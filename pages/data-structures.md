For each data structure, we'll look at the basic definition, the time complexity of index, search, insert, delete operations, and the space complexity. 

| Data Structure | Index     | Search | Insert/Delete Begin | In/Del End | In/Del Middle | Space |
| -------------- | --------- | ------ | ------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Array          | O(1)      | O(n)   | O(n)                | O(n)       | O(n           |       |
| Linked List    | O(n)      | O(n)   | O(n)                | O(n)       | O(n)          |       |
| Stack          | O(n)      | O(n)   | O(n)                | O(n)       | O(n)          |       |
| Queue          | O(n)      | O(n)   | O(n)                | O(n)       | O(n)          |       |
| Tree           | O(log(n)) | O(n)   | O(n)                | O(n)       | O(n)          |       |
| Graph          | O(n)      | O(n)   | O(n)                | O(n)       | O(n)          |       |

## Arrays

__def:__ a collection of items stored at contiguous locations in memory. Most arrays are zero-based indexed, meaning that an offset of 0 corresponds to the first entry in the array.

__benefits:__ O(1) index, best and worst

__pitfalls:__ O(n) search, insertion, and deletion

__space:__ O(n)

Arrays in Java:

int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};

System.out.println(arr[0]); // Prints '1'

## Stacks

## Queues
