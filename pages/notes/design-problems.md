The key components of a good design discussion are:
* creative thinking
* discussing design tradeoffs
* data structures/algorithms which may be used in the solution
* technology stack
* implementation time
* scalability -> can you solve different problems on different machines, shard data across machines to fit, decouple read servers and write servers, use replication across the read servers to gain performance
* extensibility
* testability
* security
* internationalization
